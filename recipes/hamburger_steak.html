        <ul class = "recip_list">
            <li>1 1/2 pounds of ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of ground mustard</li>
            <li>1 small onion diced thinly</li>
            <li>1 packed of brown gravy mix</li>
            <li>1 can of French onion condensed soup (undiluted)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of Worcestershire source</li>
        </ul>
        <ol class = "step_list">
            <li>Crumble the ground beef into a large bowl and 
                sprinkle with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, 
                and the ground mustard. Mix everything together well.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into equal parts and form into sizable patties.</li>
            <li>Place a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, place
                the steaks in the skillet, cooking for around 4 minutes without touching.
            </li>
            <li>Flip the patties over and follow the same process. Once the 4 minutes are over,
                remove the patties from the skillet pan and rest them on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>Drain away until about 2 teaspoons of the leftover grease of the pan. Apply the pan back to the heat and add the sliced onions to caramelize them.
                Cook for 3 minutes and then add the onion soup, gravy mix, and water. Stir well.
            </li>
            <li>Bring to boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, and then stir in the remaining Worcestershire sauce. Add the steaks back to the pan and finish cooking
                 for about 5 minutes or until they are done to your liking.</li>
